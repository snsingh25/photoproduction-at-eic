# photoproduction-at-eic

## Abstract 
Jets are studied in photoproduction produced ep collisions at the proposed EIC energies, $\sqrt{s}$= 30-140 GeV. The contribution of the photoproduction sub-processes, direct and resolved, are studied separately. The data is generated using the PYTHIA8 event generator. The jets are reconstructed using the longitudinally invariant $kT$-algorithm in the standalone software package FASTJET3. The substructure of the gluon-and-quark-initiated jets is studied and predictions are made for the sub-jet multiplicities in the two sub-processes. Comparison of the jet shapes in gluon versus quark jets is presented in terms thick and thin jets.
